You are required to complete the following coding tasks. You can use any programming language you’re comfortable with. For tasks 1 and 2, you are not allowed to use any convenience libraries e.g. Java Stream API or .NET LINQ. 
You are required to complete the following coding tasks. You can use any programming
language you’re comfortable with. For tasks 1 and 2, you are not allowed to use any convenience libraries e.g. Java Stream API or .NET LINQ. Once you are done, share your code via any git hosting platform (GitHub, BitBucket etc.)
1.	Complete the following tasks:
a.	Write a function is Prime that returns true if a number is prime.
b.	Write a function called memorize that takes any other function as input and returns a memorized version of that function
c.	Use the function in 3 above to memorize the is Prime function you wrote for problem 2


2.	Write a function search that accepts 2 arguments:
a.	a collection of values
b.	a value to find in the collection


The function search should implement a binary search on the collection.
If the value isn’t found in the collection, then the search function should return -1. If the value is found in the collection, then the function should return the first index of the value in the array.
For example, asked to find the value 2 in the list [1,3,2,0], your function should return 2.
